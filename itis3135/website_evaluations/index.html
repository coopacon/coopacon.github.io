    <h2><br>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://www2.pnwx.com">PNWX</a></h3>
    <p>Contrast: The PNWX website fails to create a consistent and readable text with the background turning into a dark color, making it hard to read some of the black text.
      <br>Repetition: The PNWX website does not consistently use repetition to format its website. It uses red green and white text once each while the rest of the text color remains black. It also uses bold font in the footer for text the same size near the top where it is not made bold.
      <br>Alignment: Nearly everything is centered which isnâ€™t conventional, but acceptable.
      <br>Proximity: Proximity accomplishment of relevant and similar elements is adequate.
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://burmed.com">BurMed</a></h3>
    <p>Contrast: The Burlington Medical website manages to achieve consistently readable contrasted text across the front page.
      <br>Repetition: The BurMed website upholds a chosen color pallet that is maintained apparently thoroughly.
      <br>Alignment: Alignment is centered but varied providing a reliable, yet not monotonous formatting for eyes to follow.
      <br>Proximity: Technical, informative and shopping information is formatted and grouped categorically exemplifying sufficient proximity.
