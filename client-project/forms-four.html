      <!-- Questions -->
      <h4>Strategy for Teams and Lines of Business</h4>
      
      <p>I am actively engaged in thinking about the kinds of skills needed to improve our outcomes and how to create teams with those skills. I think about how to increase sales and margins on a regular basis:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>That's my job?</label>
        <input type="radio" name="strategy" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="strategy" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="strategy" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="strategy" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="strategy" value="5"> 5  
        <label>I'm excited about a shared vision and the plan to get us there</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Planning for the Long Term</h4>
      <br>
      <p>I'm accountable for helping plan for seasons, patterns in the business, systems for year-over-year changes, and helping others buy into the plan:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>Are our numbers better than 365 days ago?</label>
        <input type="radio" name="longTerm" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="longTerm" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="longTerm" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="longTerm" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="longTerm" value="5"> 5  
        <label>We are working to plan for multiple sets of changes over the next 24 months</label>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4>Coaching Others Effectively</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Rather than "I tell you what to do," I am growing my capability in helping team members by fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills through acting as a coach:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>They should do what I told them to do the first time</label>
        <input type="radio" name="coaching" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="coaching" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="coaching" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="coaching" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="coaching" value="5"> 5  
        <label>I'm patiently working with them to watch their growth and see new capabilities</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Mentoring Others</h4>
      <br>
      <p>When it comes to specific skills and tasks, I consistently work with team members to create plans and develop practices to lead them to mastering certain job skills:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>Sometimes</label>
        <input type="radio" name="mentoring" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="mentoring" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="mentoring" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="mentoring" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="mentoring" value="5"> 5  
        <label>People seek me out to give them the tools to excel</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Succession Planning</h4>
      <br>
      <p>I know that the nature of our business means that we are constantly looking to grow people to fill open roles and equip people to be great in those roles:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>I really hope they don't quit, too</label>
        <input type="radio" name="succession" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="succession" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="succession" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="succession" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="succession" value="5"> 5  
        <label>I've got a pipeline of people and I'm excited to see who gets to step up next</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Career Planning</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Inside this business or whether the long term includes them moving to other organizations, I am thoughtful about helping team members and leaders look for the "next right step" in their career:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>TBH - I don't really even plan for me</label>
        <input type="radio" name="career" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="career" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="career" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="career" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="career" value="5"> 5  
        <label>I see the best in people and work to help them see how to get there</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Recruiting Leaders</h4>
      <br>
      <p>I'm keeping my eyes open for people who "get it" and would be great additions to our leadership team. When I find them, I work to help them picture themselves taking advantage of the benefits we can offer for their best future:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>I'm supposed to do that?</label>
        <input type="radio" name="recruiting" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="recruiting" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="recruiting" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="recruiting" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="recruiting" value="5"> 5  
        <label>I've been working on a couple of folks for a while now</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Letting Go and Empowering Others</h4>
      <br>
      <p>I know that I'm often the bottleneck in innovation and improvements, so I actively let go of control and empower others to make decisions and learn from their decisions:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>No way - too much risk! They will mess up!</label>
        <input type="radio" name="empowering" value="1" checked> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="empowering" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="empowering" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="empowering" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="empowering" value="5"> 5  
        <label>It's messy sometimes, but I'm amazed at the things they come up with</label>
      </div>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h4>Smart Risk Taking</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The business is constantly changing, and what worked well last year may not work this year at all. I help leaders come up with plans and encourage them to take risks that help the business:</p>
      <div class="radios">
        <label>Our processes are just fine already</label>
        <input type="radio" name="riskTaking" value="1"> 1 
        <input type="radio" name="riskTaking" value="2"> 2 
        <input type="radio" name="riskTaking" value="3"> 3 
        <input type="radio" name="riskTaking" value="4"> 4 
        <input type="radio" name="riskTaking" value="5"> 5  
        <label>It's exciting when someone comes up with a great idea!</label>
      </div>
