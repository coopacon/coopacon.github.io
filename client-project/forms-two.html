Definition of the schedule:  When does the work need to be done? Definition of quality: When the work is done well, how will we measure that and agree that it is working well?</p>

Agenda: What is a good list of topics to cover?  How much time is needed for each? Schedule:  When should the meeting happen in order to support everyone's goals? Facilitation: How can I help everyone participate and accomplish the meeting goal?</p>
