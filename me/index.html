    <p>Personal Background:  I was born in Maryland and I moved here just over 10 years ago.
      <br>Professional Background: I am an Eagle Scout and just finished a children’s software/filming teaching job at Blackrocket over the summer.
      <br>Academic Background:  I am studying computer science with a minor in Software Engineering. I am currently starting my Senior year.
      <br>Background in this Subject:  I’ve very lightly touched html before.
      <br>Primary Computer Platform:  MacOS.
      <br>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:
      <br>2122 - Intro to Prob and Stat: I want to have a better understanding on how to quantitatively analyze date.
      <br>3146 - Intro to Oper Syst and Net CI: I can’t wait to have a more thorough understanding of the underlying process beneath the hardware of a computer.
      <br>3155 - Software Engineering: This is my minor, and will be useful to know having broad application.
      <br>3135 - Web-based App Design and Dev Software and Info Sys: I want to better learn the thoughts and process behind web designers’ approach and actual means of building.
      <br>3310 - Software Arch &amp; Design Software and Info Sys: I think it would be fundamentally beneficial to attain a thorough understanding of design, forethought and overall architecture building process.
      <br>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: I was in the CCP program at RCCC before I transferred so I’m only 19 and in my senior year.
      <br>I'd also like to Share:  I feel like I still have a lot to learn.
